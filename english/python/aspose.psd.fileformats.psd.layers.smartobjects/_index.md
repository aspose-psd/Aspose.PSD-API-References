## **Classes**
| **Class** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [SmartObjectLayer](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.smartobjects/smartobjectlayer/) | Defines the SmartObjectLayer class that contains embedded in the PSD file or linked smart object in the external file.<br/>            With Smart Objects, you can:<br/>            Perform nondestructive transforms. You can scale, rotate, skew, distort, perspective transform, or warp a layer<br/>            without losing original image data or quality because the transforms don�t affect the original data.<br/>            Work with vector data, such as vector artwork from Illustrator, that otherwise would be rasterized.<br/>            Perform nondestructive filtering. You can edit filters applied to Smart Objects at any time.<br/>            Edit one Smart Object and automatically update all its linked instances.<br/>            Apply a layer mask that�s either linked or unlinked to the Smart Object layer.<br/>            Try various designs with low-resolution placeholder images that you later replace with final versions.<br/>            In Adobe� Photoshop�, you can embed the contents of an image into a PSD document.<br/>            More information is here: <see href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/create-smart-objects.html" /><br/>            A layer with an embedded smart object contains placed (PlLd) and SoLd resources with smart object properties.<br/>            The PlLd resource can be alone for PSD versions older then 10.<br/>            These resources contain UniqueId of the LiFdDataSource in the global Lnk2Resource with the embedded filename<br/>            and other parameters, including the embedded file contents in the original format as a byte array. |
