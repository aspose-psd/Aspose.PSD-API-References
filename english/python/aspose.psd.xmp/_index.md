The module contains XMP related helper classes and methods.

## **Classes**
| **Class** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [IXmlValue](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/ixmlvalue/) | Converts xmp values to the XML string representation. |
| [LangAlt](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/langalt/) | Represents XMP Language Alternative. |
| [Namespaces](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/namespaces/) | Contains namespaces used in RDF document. |
| [XmpArray](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmparray/) | Represents Xmp Array in [XmpPackage](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmppackage/). TODO: Array may contain complex data. |
| [XmpArrayHelper](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmparrayhelper/) | The helper class for processing RDF logic |
| [XmpElementBase](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmpelementbase/) | Represents base xmp element contains attributes. |
| [XmpHeaderPi](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmpheaderpi/) | Represents XMP header processing instruction. |
| [XmpMeta](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmpmeta/) | Represents xmpmeta. Optional.<br/>            The purpose of this element is to identify XMP metadata within general XML text that might contain other non-XMP uses of RDF. |
| [XmpPackage](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmppackage/) | Defines the XmpPackage class that represents base abstraction for XMP package. |
| [XmpPackageBaseCollection](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmppackagebasecollection/) | Represents collection of [XmpPackage](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmppackage/). |
| [XmpPacketWrapper](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmppacketwrapper/) | Contains serialized xmp package including header and trailer. |
| [XmpRdfRoot](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmprdfroot/) | Represents rdf:RDF element.<br/>            A single XMP packet shall be serialized using a single rdf:RDF XML element. The rdf:RDF element content shall consist of only zero or more rdf:Description elements. |
| [XmpTrailerPi](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmptrailerpi/) | Represents XMP trailer processing instruction. |
## **Enumerations**
| **Enumeration** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [XmpArrayType](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmparraytype/) | Represents array type in [XmpArray](/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.xmp/xmparray/). |
