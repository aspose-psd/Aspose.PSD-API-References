## RenderQuality enumeration

It describes the rendering quality of Warp.

```csharp
public enum RenderQuality
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turbo | `4` | The fastest option, but the quality suffers. |
| VeryFast | `18` | If you need it fast, it may be suitable for small curvatures. |
| Fast | `35` | Allows you to make rendering faster with a small drop in quality. |
| Normal | `60` | Recommended value for most curvatures |
| Good | `130` | Higher than standard quality, slower speed. Recommended for strong distortions. |
| Excellent | `260` | The slowest option. Recommended for strong distortions and high resolutions. |
