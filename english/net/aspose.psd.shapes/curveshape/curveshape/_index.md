## CurveShape constructor (1 of 5)

Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../../curveshape) class.

```csharp
public CurveShape()
```

### See Also

* class [CurveShape](../../curveshape)
* namespace [Aspose.PSD.Shapes](../../curveshape)
* assembly [Aspose.PSD](../../../)

---

## CurveShape constructor (2 of 5)

Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../../curveshape) class. The default tension of 0.5 is used.

```csharp
public CurveShape(PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| points | PointF[] | The points array. |

### See Also

* struct [PointF](../../../aspose.psd/pointf)
* class [CurveShape](../../curveshape)
* namespace [Aspose.PSD.Shapes](../../curveshape)
* assembly [Aspose.PSD](../../../)

## CurveShape constructor (3 of 5)

Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../../curveshape) class. The default tension of 0.5 is used.

```csharp
public CurveShape(PointF[] points, bool isClosed)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| points | PointF[] | The points array. |
| isClosed | Boolean | if set to `true` the curve is closed. |

### See Also
