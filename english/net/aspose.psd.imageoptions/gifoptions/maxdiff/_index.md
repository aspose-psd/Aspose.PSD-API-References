## GifOptions.MaxDiff property

Gets or sets the maximum allowed pixel difference. If greater than zero, lossy compression will be used. Recommended value for optimal lossy compression is 80. 30 is very light compression, 200 is heavy. It works best when only little loss is introduced, and due to limitation of the compression algorithm very high loss levels won't give as much gain. The range of allowed values is [0, 1000].

```csharp
public int MaxDiff { get; set; }
```
