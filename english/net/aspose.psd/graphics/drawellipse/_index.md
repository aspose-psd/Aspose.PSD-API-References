## Graphics.DrawEllipse method (1 of 4)

Draws an ellipse defined by a bounding [`RectangleF`](../../rectanglef).

```csharp
public void DrawEllipse(Pen pen, RectangleF rect)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | [`Pen`](../../pen) that determines the color, width, and style of the ellipse. |
| rect | RectangleF | [`RectangleF`](../../rectanglef) structure that defines the boundaries of the ellipse. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *pen* is null. |

## Graphics.DrawEllipse method (2 of 4)

Draws an ellipse defined by a bounding rectangle specified by a pair of coordinates, a height, and a width.

```csharp
public void DrawEllipse(Pen pen, float x, float y, float width, float height)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | [`Pen`](../../pen) that determines the color, width, and style of the ellipse. |
| x | Single | The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| y | Single | The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| width | Single | Width of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| height | Single | Height of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |

### Exceptions
