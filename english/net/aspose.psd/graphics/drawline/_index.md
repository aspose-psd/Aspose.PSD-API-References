## DrawLine(Pen, Point, Point) {#drawline}

Draws a line connecting two [`Point`](../../point/) structures.

```csharp
public void DrawLine(Pen pen, Point point1, Point point2)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | [`Pen`](../../pen/) that determines the color, width, and style of the line. |
| point1 | Point | [`Point`](../../point/) structure that represents the first point to connect. |
| point2 | Point | [`Point`](../../point/) structure that represents the second point to connect. |
