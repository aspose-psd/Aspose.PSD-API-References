## Graphics.FillPie method (1 of 4)

Fills the interior of a pie section defined by an ellipse specified by a [`RectangleF`](../../rectanglef) structure and two radial lines.

```csharp
public void FillPie(Brush brush, Rectangle rect, float startAngle, float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| rect | Rectangle | [`Rectangle`](../../rectangle) structure that represents the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| startAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the first side of the pie section. |
| sweepAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the *startAngle* parameter to the second side of the pie section. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. |

* struct [Rectangle](../../rectangle)
* class [Graphics](../../graphics)

## Graphics.FillPie method (3 of 4)

Fills the interior of a pie section defined by an ellipse specified by a pair of coordinates, a width, a height, and two radial lines.

```csharp
public void FillPie(Brush brush, float x, float y, float width, float height, float startAngle, 
    float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| x | Single | The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| y | Single | The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| width | Single | Width of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| height | Single | Height of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| startAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the first side of the pie section. |
| sweepAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the *startAngle* parameter to the second side of the pie section. |

### Exceptions
