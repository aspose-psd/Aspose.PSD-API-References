## Graphics.DrawArc method (1 of 4)

Draws an arc representing a portion of an ellipse specified by a pair of coordinates, a width, and a height.

```csharp
public void DrawArc(Pen pen, float x, float y, float width, float height, float startAngle, 
    float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | [`Pen`](../../pen) that determines the color, width, and style of the arc. |
| x | Single | The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| y | Single | The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| width | Single | Width of the rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| height | Single | Height of the rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| startAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the starting point of the arc. |
| sweepAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the *startAngle* parameter to ending point of the arc. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *pen* is null. |

## Graphics.DrawArc method (2 of 4)

Draws an arc representing a portion of an ellipse specified by a [`RectangleF`](../../rectanglef) structure.

```csharp
public void DrawArc(Pen pen, RectangleF rect, float startAngle, float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | [`Pen`](../../pen) that determines the color, width, and style of the arc. |
| rect | RectangleF | [`RectangleF`](../../rectanglef) structure that defines the boundaries of the ellipse. |
| startAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the starting point of the arc. |
| sweepAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the *startAngle* parameter to ending point of the arc. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |

| width | Int32 | Width of the rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| height | Int32 | Height of the rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| startAngle | Int32 | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the starting point of the arc. |
| sweepAngle | Int32 | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the *startAngle* parameter to ending point of the arc. |
