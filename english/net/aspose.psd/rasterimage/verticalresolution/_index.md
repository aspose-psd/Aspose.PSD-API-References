## RasterImage.VerticalResolution property

Gets or sets the vertical resolution, in pixels per inch, of this [`RasterImage`](../../rasterimage).

```csharp
public virtual double VerticalResolution { get; set; }
```

## Property Value

The vertical resolution.

### Remarks

Note by default this value is always 96 since different platforms cannot return the screen resolution. You may consider using the SetResolution method for updating both resolution values in single call.
