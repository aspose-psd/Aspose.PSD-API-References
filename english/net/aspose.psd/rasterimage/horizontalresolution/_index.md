## RasterImage.HorizontalResolution property

Gets or sets the horizontal resolution, in pixels per inch, of this [`RasterImage`](../../rasterimage).

```csharp
public virtual double HorizontalResolution { get; set; }
```

## Property Value

The horizontal resolution.

### Remarks

Note by default this value is always 96 since different platforms cannot return the screen resolution. You may consider using the SetResolution method for updating both resolution values in single call.
