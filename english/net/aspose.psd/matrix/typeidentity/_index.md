An identity transform is one in which the output coordinates are always the same as the input coordinates. If this transform is anything other than the identity transform, the type will either be the constant GENERAL_TRANSFORM or a combination of the appropriate flag bits for the various coordinate conversions that this transform performs.

public const int TypeIdentity;
```
