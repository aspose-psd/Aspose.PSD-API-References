## Point structure

Represents an ordered pair of integer x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.

```csharp
public struct Point
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Point](point)(int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](../point) structure using coordinates specified by an integer value. |
| [Point](point)(Size) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](../point) structure from the [`Size`](../size) structure. |
| [Point](point)(int, int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](../point) structure with the specified coordinates. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Empty](../../aspose.psd/point/empty) { get; } | Gets a new instance of the [`Point`](../point) structure that has [`X`](./x) and [`Y`](./y) values set to zero. |
| [IsEmpty](../../aspose.psd/point/isempty) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this [`Point`](../point) is empty. |
| [X](../../aspose.psd/point/x) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this [`Point`](../point). |
| [Y](../../aspose.psd/point/y) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this [`Point`](../point). |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Add](../../aspose.psd/point/add)(Point, Size) | Adds the specified [`Size`](../size) to the specified [`Point`](../point). |
| static [Ceiling](../../aspose.psd/point/ceiling)(PointF) | Converts the specified [`PointF`](../pointf) to a [`Point`](../point) by rounding the values of the [`PointF`](../pointf) to the next higher integer values. |
| static [Round](../../aspose.psd/point/round)(PointF) | Converts the specified [`PointF`](../pointf) to a [`Point`](../point) object by rounding the [`Point`](../point) values to the nearest integer. |
| static [Subtract](../../aspose.psd/point/subtract)(Point, Size) | Returns the result of subtracting specified [`Size`](../size) from the specified [`Point`](../point). |
| static [Truncate](../../aspose.psd/point/truncate)(PointF) | Converts the specified [`PointF`](../pointf) to a [`Point`](../point) by truncating the values of the [`Point`](../point). |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.psd/point/equals)(object) | Specifies whether this [`Point`](../point) contains the same coordinates as the specified Object. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.psd/point/gethashcode)() | Returns a hash code for this [`Point`](../point). |
| [Offset](../../aspose.psd/point/offset)(Point) | Translates this [`Point`](../point) by the specified [`Point`](../point). |
| [Offset](../../aspose.psd/point/offset)(int, int) | Translates this [`Point`](../point) by the specified amount. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.psd/point/tostring)() | Converts this [`Point`](../point) to a human-readable string. |
| [operator +](../../aspose.psd/point/op_addition) | Translates a [`Point`](../point) by a given [`Size`](../size). |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.psd/point/op_equality) | Compares two [`Point`](../point) objects. The result specifies whether the values of the [`X`](./x) and [`Y`](./y) properties of the two [`Point`](../point) objects are equal. |
| [explicit operator](../../aspose.psd/point/op_explicit) | Converts the specified [`Point`](../point) structure to a [`Size`](../size) structure. |
| [implicit operator](../../aspose.psd/point/op_implicit) | Converts the specified [`Point`](../point) structure to the [`PointF`](../pointf) structure. |
| [operator !=](../../aspose.psd/point/op_inequality) | Compares two [`Point`](../point) objects. The result specifies whether the values of the [`X`](./x) or [`Y`](./y) properties of the two [`Point`](../point) objects are unequal. |
| [operator -](../../aspose.psd/point/op_subtraction) | Translates a [`Point`](../point) by the negative of a given [`Size`](../size). |
