## StrokePosition enumeration

The position setting controls the alignment of your stroke to the layer it's applied to in the [`StrokeEffect`](../strokeeffect).

```csharp
public enum StrokePosition : short
```

## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inside | `0` | The stroke will be created from the edge of the shape and grow inward, to the center of the object. |
| Center | `1` | The stroke will be created from the edge of the shape and grow both inwards and outwards. |
| Outside | `2` | The stroke will be created from the edge of the shape and will grow outwards, away from the object. |
