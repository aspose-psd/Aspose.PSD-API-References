## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |

| [RawColor](./rawcolor/) | Raw Color Class helps to store colors with any channels count, any color mode and any bit depth Please note, some internal classes can have issues with converting RawColor to its' native format, so if API provides for you CMYK color, it's more reliable to use the provided format. Also, there are can be some cases when Raw Color can be converted |
