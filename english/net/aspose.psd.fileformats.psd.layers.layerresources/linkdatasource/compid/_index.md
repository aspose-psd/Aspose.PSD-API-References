## LinkDataSource.CompId property

Gets or sets the ID of the currently selected comp for the child document, which will be -1 if none are selected. Comps are compositions of a page layout which designers can create. Using layer comps, you can create, manage, and view multiple versions of a layout in a single Adobe® Photoshop® file. A layer comp is a snapshot of a state of the Layers panel. Layer comps save three types of layer options but this property gets the Layer Comp selection identifier for Smart Objects.

```csharp
public int CompId { get; set; }
```

## Property Value

The ID of the currently selected comp for the child document, which will be -1 if none are selected.
