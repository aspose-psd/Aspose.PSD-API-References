## PathOperations enumeration

The operations for the path shapes combining (Boolean operations).

```csharp
public enum PathOperations
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ExcludeOverlappingShapes | `0` | Exclude Overlapping Shapes (XOR operation). |
| CombineShapes | `1` | Combine Shapes (OR operation). This is default value in Photoshop. |
| SubtractFrontShape | `2` | Subtract Front Shape (NOT operation). |
| IntersectShapeAreas | `3` | Intersect Shape Areas (AND operation). |

### Examples

The following code example demonstrates the support of new LengthRecord properties, PathOperations (boolean operations), ShapeIndex and BezierKnotRecordsCount.

```csharp
[C#]

string sourceFilePath = "PathOperationsShape.psd";
string outputFilePath = "out_PathOperationsShape.psd";

using (var im = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    VsmsResource resource = null;
    foreach (var layerResource in im.Layers[1].Resources)
    {
        if (layerResource is VsmsResource)
        {
            resource = (VsmsResource)layerResource;
            break;
        }
    }

    LengthRecord lengthRecord0 = (LengthRecord)resource.Paths[2];
    LengthRecord lengthRecord1 = (LengthRecord)resource.Paths[7];
    LengthRecord lengthRecord2 = (LengthRecord)resource.Paths[11];

    // Here we changin the way to combining betwen shapes.
    lengthRecord0.PathOperations = PathOperations.ExcludeOverlappingShapes;
    lengthRecord1.PathOperations = PathOperations.IntersectShapeAreas;
    lengthRecord2.PathOperations = PathOperations.SubtractFrontShape;

    im.Save(outputFilePath);
}
```
