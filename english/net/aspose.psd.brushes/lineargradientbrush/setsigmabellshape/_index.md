```csharp
public void SetSigmaBellShape(float focus)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| focus | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies the center of the gradient (the point where the starting color and ending color are blended equally). |

## SetSigmaBellShape(float, float) {#setsigmabellshape_1}

Creates a gradient falloff based on a bell-shaped curve.

```csharp
public void SetSigmaBellShape(float focus, float scale)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| focus | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies the center of the gradient (the point where the gradient is composed of only the ending color). |
| scale | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies how fast the colors falloff from the *focus*. |
