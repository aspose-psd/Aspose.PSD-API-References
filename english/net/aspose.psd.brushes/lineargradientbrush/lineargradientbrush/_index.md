## LinearGradientBrush constructor (1 of 7)

Initializes a new instance of the [`LinearGradientBrush`](../../lineargradientbrush) class with default parameters. The starting color is black, the ending color is white, the angle is 45 degrees and the rectangle is located in (0,0) with size (1,1).

```csharp
public LinearGradientBrush()
```
