### Examples

This example shows the creation and usage Pen objects. The example creates a new Image and draws Rectangles on Image surface.

```csharp
[C#]

//Create an instance of Image
using (Aspose.PSD.Image image = new Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.PsdImage(500, 500))
{
    //Create an instance of Graphics and initialize it with Image object
    Aspose.PSD.Graphics graphics = new Aspose.PSD.Graphics(image);

    //Clear the Graphics sutface with White Color
    graphics.Clear(Aspose.PSD.Color.White);

    //Create an instance of Pen with color Red and width 5
    Aspose.PSD.Pen pen = new Pen(Aspose.PSD.Color.Red, 5);

    //Create an instance of HatchBrush and set its properties
    Aspose.PSD.Brushes.HatchBrush brush = new Aspose.PSD.Brushes.HatchBrush();
    brush.BackgroundColor = Color.Wheat;
    brush.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;

    //Create an instance of Pen
    //initialize it with HatchBrush object and width
    Aspose.PSD.Pen brusedpen = new Pen(brush, 5);

    //Draw Rectangles by specifying Pen object
    graphics.DrawRectangles(pen, new[] { new Rectangle(new Point(210, 210), new Size(100, 100)), new Rectangle(new Point(110, 110), new Size(100, 100)), new Rectangle(new Point(310, 310), new Size(100, 100)) });

    //Draw Rectangles by specifying Pen object
    graphics.DrawRectangles(brusedpen, new[] { new Rectangle(new Point(310, 110), new Size(100, 100)), new Rectangle(new Point(110, 310), new Size(100, 100)) });

    // Create export options and initialize them.
    Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions.Jpeg2000Options options = new Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions.Jpeg2000Options();

    // save all changes.
