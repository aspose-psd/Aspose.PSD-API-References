## SetBlendTriangularShape(float) {#setblendtriangularshape}

Creates a gradient with a center color and a linear falloff to one surrounding color.

```csharp
public void SetBlendTriangularShape(float focus)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| focus | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies where, along any radial from the center of the path to the path's boundary, the center color will be at its highest intensity. A value of 1 (the default) places the highest intensity at the center of the path. |

## SetBlendTriangularShape(float, float) {#setblendtriangularshape_1}

Creates a gradient with a center color and a linear falloff to each surrounding color.

```csharp
public void SetBlendTriangularShape(float focus, float scale)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| focus | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies where, along any radial from the center of the path to the path's boundary, the center color will be at its highest intensity. A value of 1 (the default) places the highest intensity at the center of the path. |
| scale | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies the maximum intensity of the center color that gets blended with the boundary color. A value of 1 causes the highest possible intensity of the center color, and it is the default value. |
