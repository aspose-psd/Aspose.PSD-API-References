## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [HatchBrush](./hatchbrush/) | Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [LinearGradientBrush](./lineargradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) with a linear gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [LinearGradientBrushBase](./lineargradientbrushbase/) | Represents a [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) with gradient capabilities and appropriate properties. |
| [LinearMulticolorGradientBrush](./linearmulticolorgradientbrush/) | Represents a [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) with linear gradient defined by multiple colors and appropriate positions. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [PathGradientBrush](./pathgradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [PathGradientBrushBase](./pathgradientbrushbase/) | Represents a [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) with base path gradient functionality. |
| [PathMulticolorGradientBrush](./pathmulticolorgradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [SolidBrush](./solidbrush/) | Solid brush is intended for drawing continiously with specific color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [TextureBrush](./texturebrush/) | Each property of the [`TextureBrush`](../aspose.psd.brushes/texturebrush/) class is a [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) object that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [TransformBrush](./transformbrush/) | A [`Brush`](../aspose.psd/brush/) with transform capabilities. |
